## 🎯 About Me

**From battlefield to codebase** - I'm leveraging a decade of high-stakes leadership and medical expertise to build AI systems that enhance human capabilities and save lives. As a **Special Forces Medical Sergeant** turned **AI Engineer**, I bring military precision, adaptability, and mission-first thinking to complex technical challenges.

Currently completing my **M.S. in Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, with focus on medical AI applications, computer vision, and neural networks.

```python
class MissionStatement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.background = "10+ years Special Forces Medical Leadership"
        self.deployments = 5
        self.education = "M.S. Artificial Intelligence (2025)"
        self.mission = "Building AI that saves lives and enhances human potential"
        self.specialization = ["Medical AI", "Computer Vision", "Emergency Response Systems"]
    
    def unique_value(self):
        return "Military precision + Technical innovation + Healthcare expertise"
```
